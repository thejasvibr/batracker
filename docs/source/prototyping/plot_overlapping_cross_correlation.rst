When calls arrive almost/overlapping
====================================

Solution 1:
    
    #. Do the cross-correlation anyway - the multiple peaks might be picked up, and 
    the relative channel delays suggested by both the peaks could be tried out anyway
    #. Do the cross-correlation after 'intra-audio normalisation' - that is, make sure
    the RMS profile within the sound region to be cross correlated is uniform. This 
    prevents false positive peaks from forming during the cross correlation. 

Broad findings:
    
    #. Hilbert envelope based audio-normalisation could work, at least for the 
    simple case of overlapping calls (without reverb etc.)

Now make a channel with no overlaps, and a channel with two calls arriving very
close to  each other.

    make_wav_and_spec(ch2)


    cc = signal.correlate(ch1, ch2, 'same')
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(cc)
    plt.vlines(cc.size/2.0, 0, np.max(cc))

The peaks are of very different heights which means that the delays will of course 
be interpreted badly. Now, let's equalise the waveform somehow. 


.. code-block:: default


    hilbert_tr = signal.hilbert(mixed_ampch2)
    hilbert_envelope = np.abs(hilbert_tr)
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(mixed_ampch2)
    plt.plot(hilbert_envelope)

    max_env = np.max(hilbert_envelope)
    amp_factor = hilbert_envelope/max_env

    uniform_amp = mixed_ampch2*(1/amp_factor)

    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(hilbert_envelope)
    plt.plot(uniform_amp)


    processed_cc = signal.correlate(ch1, uniform_amp, 'same')
    plt.figure()

Let's compare the raw overlapping calls CC with the intra-audio normlised
The peaks from the intra-audio normalised CC is definitely much larger than 
just the raw CC - which shows that the intra-audio normalisation definitely helps!


.. code-block:: default


    plt.figure()
    plt.subplot(211)
    plt.plot(cc_mixedamp)
    plt.vlines(cc_mixedamp.size/2.0, 0, np.max(cc_mixedamp))
    plt.title('Raw mixed amplitude CC')
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.subplot(212)
    plt.plot(processed_cc)
    plt.vlines(processed_cc.size/2.0, 0, np.max(processed_cc))
    plt.title('Amplitude adjusted CC')

One thing to pay attention to - the SNR before actually doing the envelope 
based normalisation. If the SNR is already low - then it'd mean the noise would 
be amplified -- and mess up the CC.
