Welcome to batracker's documentation!

`batracker` is designed to help you track sounds with a modular design. 
There are four main parts of any kind of acoustic tracking:

`Project under construction !!`
-------------------------------
This project is currently under construction, and most of the functions are currently in prototyping stage.
This page is a place to dump my thoughts and organise the project. I'm currently devoted limited time per day 
on this project, and am looking to formally find funding to push this project forward majorly. If you're interested
in collaborating on this repo do send me a message at thejasvib@gmail.com. 

Signal detection
----------------

This part deals with how the signal of interest is actually detected. Each type of signal to be detected
may need special detection algorithms (eg. simple thresholds, neural networks), and this part of the package
provides the API for detection only.

Correspondence matching
----------------------- 
Having detected all signals within a channel, now each signal in a channel must be matched with another one from other channels. 
Here there are a couple of algorithms that can be used, based on how dense the sounds are across the channels. The most naive algorithm
assumes that sounds of interest are emitted with long gaps of silence. Each sound in a channel is matched with the sound in other channels
that is :math:`\pm \Delta T`, where :math:`\Delta T` is the maximum possible time difference of arrival between one channel to another. :math:`\Delta T`
corresponds to the largest inter-microphone distance in an array.

Time delay estimation
--------------------- 
All matched signals are compared and their time-difference of arrivals (TDOAs) are measured using various methods.  
The simplest method is of course to perform a cross-correlation, and the difference in the position of the peaks 
is the time-delay of arrival.

Localisation
------------ 
With the TDOAs in hand, now the position of the source can be calculated. According the algorithm at hand the source position is calculated using 
all the available (independent) TDOAs or only a subset of them.

This part of the package deals with the act of using the TDOAs and generating
the source signal positions.
