Correspondence matching prototyping
===================================
Implements the most basic type of correspondence matching -  which matches
signals across all channels to a single source emission. 

In this prototyping example, the simplest algorithm is used to find correspondences. 
The maximum inter-channel delay is calculated based on the longest dimension of the 
array, from the reference mic to the focal mic. 



Possible approaches
