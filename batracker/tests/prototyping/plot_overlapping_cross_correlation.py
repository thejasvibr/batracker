"""
When calls arrive almost/overlapping
====================================

Solution 1:
    
    #. Do the cross-correlation anyway - the multiple peaks might be picked up, and 
    the relative channel delays suggested by both the peaks could be tried out anyway
    #. Do the cross-correlation after 'intra-audio normalisation' - that is, make sure
    the RMS profile within the sound region to be cross correlated is uniform. This 
    prevents false positive peaks from forming during the cross correlation. 

Broad findings:
    
    #. Hilbert envelope based audio-normalisation could work, at least for the 
    simple case of overlapping calls (without reverb etc.)
