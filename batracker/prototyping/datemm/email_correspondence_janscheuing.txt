Hello Thejasvi,

proud to read that my papers are still read :-)
Bat calls in reverberant caves... yes, that sounds challenging.

So my first intention after I read your mail forwarded by Prof. Yang was
"of course I would like to support your studies and will share the
code". The second thought was something like "OMG, it was already 13
years ago, time is running".
Finally the question "where is the code and in what state..." came into
my mind - as I remembered that later I integrated DATEMM into a quite
complex online localization demonstrator environment with OpenGL-based,
touch screen controlled 3D visualization (cutting edge in those days I
guess) and therefore rewrote it in a no-more-obvious C :-)

So I searched in my backups (don't worry, I suprised myself who quick I
could find it) and attached you the basis MATLAB-version of DATEMM. In
my today's eyes, the code has much too little comments, it is not
self-explaining and I'm not sure if I'ld still be able to explain every
line, although the lines were definitely all written by me - sorry for
that. Nevertheless I'm sure you can find a way through...

As starting point and as far as I remember:

messung.m contains the framework, plotting real and detected sources,
microphones and walls of my demo room and providing measured
(synchronous) 8 mic channels to the algorithm.

main_18.m contains the main DATEMM algo, calling different subfunctions,
some of them already written in C and mex-compiled for speed-up. I
remember I also had different localization algos, the one included is
the One-Step-Least-Squares by Huang (hope you know/find the paper),
which seems to be my choice of a best tradeoff in performance vs.
runtime consumption at that time.

I guess some functions (including the subfolder) are off-topic, I had
some acoustic room emulations running in parallel - so just ignore.

Feel free to ask questions, but don't expect too much support.
Also feel free to use, extend, optimize the code within you studies.
In case of any publishing, patent application, licencing, value
creation, ... I would be glad if you would remember me.

Best regards
Jan Scheuing
