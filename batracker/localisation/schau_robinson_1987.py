Localising sounds with the  Schau & Robinson 1987 algorithm
===========================================================

The Schau & Robinson algorithm formulates the localisatin problem into finding
a series of intersecting spheres, instead of hyperbolas. This also means that 
there are two possible solutions to the localisation. The user will need to choose
the relevant option. 

The input variables
-------------------
The Schau & Robinson paper defines a bunch of input variables:
    #. :math:`M`
    #. :math:`d`
    #. :math:`x`
    #. :math:`\Delta`  , where :math:`\Delta` itself is a matrix with
       :math:`{R_{i}}^2 - {d_{i4}}^2`. :math:`R_{i}` is the distance from 
       mic `i` to the origin (mic 4), and :math:`d_{i4}` is the range
       difference to the source between mic `i` and mic 4 (Eqn. 1), :math:`d_{i4}=D_{i}-D_{4}`

def schau_robinson_solution(array_geometry, d):
    '''
    Parameters
    ----------
    array_geometry: np.array
        A 4x3 array with xyz coordinates of 4 mics.
        The last mic will be taken as the reference microphone.
    d:  np.array
        A 3x1 np.array with the range_differences to the source. 
        All range_differences (:math:`d_{i4}`), are calculated by
        taking :math:`D_{i}-D_{4}`, where :math:`D` is the direct
        range from a mic to the source.
    
    Returns
    -------
    x_real_world : list
        A list with 2 3x1 np.arrays with the x,y,z positions of the source.
        The two xyz positions describe two possible solutions to the given 
        array geometry and range differences.
    
    Attention
    ---------
    The Schau-Robinson algorithm does not work consistently for microphone arrays
    that have mics in the same plane (eg. 'flat' arrays with a common y coordinate)

    For example, when using the Schau-Robinson on the flat tristar array [1]- all sources
    always have a faulty 0 'y' coordinate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : np.array
        3 x 3 array with the xyz coordinates of the microphones.
        All positions are relative to mic 4, as the last mic is considered
        to be the origin (0,0,0)
    Delta  : np.array
        Matrix, :math:`\Delta` in the paper, with :math:`{R_{i}}^2 - {d_{i4}}^2`, where is is from 1-3,
        and refers to mic number. 
        :math:`R_{i}` is the distance from mic `i` to the origin. 
        :math:`d_{i4}` is the difference in source to mic travel distance
        between mic `i` and mic 4 (See Eqn 1&2).
    Rs : tuple with 2 entries
        The two values of source range arising from the quadratic equation in Eq.13. 
    d : np.array
        The distances between each of the mics to the reference fourth mic. 
        Each distance is notated as :math:`d_{i4}` in the paper. 
    
    
    Returns
    -------
    X_1, X_2 : np.arrays
        The x,y,z coordinates of the source, with the origin of the coordinate 
        system set at mic 4. 


    Notes
    -----
    The :math:`R_{s}` will have two range solutions, which also means that there
    will be two solutions of X. The user must make a prudent choice about which values
    are relevant for the situation.
