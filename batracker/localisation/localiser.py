'''Localiser module

Deals with assigning signals across channels to the same sound, 
and localising the sound to its source

import numpy as np

def localise(multichannel_candidates, microphone_positions, **kwargs):
    '''
    Parameters
    ----------
    multichannel_candidates : list with sublists.
        Each sublist contains candidate regions where the signal of interest
        has been detected
    microphone_positions : np.array
        Mmics x 3 np.array with the xyz positions of the mics. 
        Each mic is in a new row
    v_sound : float, optional
        Speed of sound in m/s. Defaults to 331 m/s. 
    formulation : str
        The mathematical formulation used to localise sounds
        Available options include 
        #. Schau & Robinson 1987, IEEE Trans. Acoust. Speech & Sig. Proc.
            

    Returns
    -------
    source_positions : np.array

    
    Notes
    -----
    Error in the input data can contribute to errors in the actual source localisation.
    
    Error in microphone position estimation can contribute to errors in source position
    estimation, especially when dealing with sources that are a bit further away [1]. 
    At least in air, variation in the speed of sound is rather unlikely to contribute to big 
    errors, and the error will also be homogenous in space (cause a uniform contraction
    or expansion of all position estimates).

    Multiple sounds are detected within a channel and across channel. 
    Each detecting in a channel needs to be grouped together with 
    other detections across channels to proceed further with localisations.
